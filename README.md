# misc-tools

This project is primarily for tracking-purposes. Git's a great place to stash stuff you don't want to go up in a *poof!* of bits when a laptop's harddrive dies.

At any rate, please feel free to borrow and improve anything in here that you find useful.

Each tool will have an associated README to provide guidance on its use and expected use-cases.
